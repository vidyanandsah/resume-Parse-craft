NLP and Generative AI

Welcome to the exciting world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generative AI. Now is the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and it is being incorporated into more and more areas of work. Since NLP is a prerequisite for understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) work and has its own applications, it is essential for us to learn NLP thoroughly before moving on to the generative AI part. We will start from the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and then move on to the generative AI part. Our final aim will be to create an AI bot that can help us filter resumes and provide only the required details about the candidates in brief, so that one doesn't have to waste time in reading the resumes.

Pre-Requisites: A working computer and a good internet connection. Apart from that, we just need loads and loads of enthusiasm from your side.
